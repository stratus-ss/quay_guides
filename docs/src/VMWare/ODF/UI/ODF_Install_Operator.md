### Install ODF Operator Via The UI

In the UI, as a cluster admin user, navigate to **Operators --> Operators --> Operator Hub** and filter for ODF:

![odf_operator1.png](../../images/odf_operator1.png)

On the next screen just click install. There are no configurable options on this screen.

![odf_operator2.png](../../images/odf_operator2.png)

Finally, it is safe to accept the defaults. For more advanced users, these options can be adjusted.

At this point the operator is installed and ready to be configured. Jump to either the Noobaa or Multicloud Object Gateway sections below
